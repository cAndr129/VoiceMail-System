# VoiceMail-System

This voicemail system was designed as a way to practice going through the full development cycle of creating an application.

UML:
  For the system Use Case diagrams, class diagrams, CRC cards, and a complax sequence diagram were created to flesh out how the system needed to be designed. These documents were utilized to then implement the system into the actual coded system. 
 
VoiceMail System:
  The system itself is designed as a navigation through a series of menus, running in the console of a computer. The system will ask the user questions, and navigate the user to their correct destination. The user can give input to the system, where that input will then be saved and can be reaccessed anytime within the lifetime of the program. The user can also make changes to data that is saved in the system, like passwords and voicemail greetings and these changes will be updated and immediately reflected in the system, without restarting the system.
